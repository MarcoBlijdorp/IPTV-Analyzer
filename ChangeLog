    * Version 0.10.0
        
    Merged some updates from others:
        Able to build module for Kernel 4.5.4-1 of newer <Falien164>
            https://github.com/netoptimizer/IPTV-Analyzer/pull/33
 
        RTP support <Tilka>
            https://github.com/Tilka/IPTV-Analyzer/commit/544bce95606fa816af414a43a3b01dd7b6abc717

    My own contribution:
        Support for Image_Graph seems to have stopped long ago and I couldn't get it to work with PHP7.
        Instead I've build a new front-end using NodeJs using Plotly (https://plotly.com/javascript/) for the graphs.

        Added a howto which worked for my Raspberry Pi4
        

2015-03-04  Jesper Dangaard Brouer <netoptimizer@brouer.com>

	* Version 0.9.4.

	It has been quite some time since the last release.

	This release primarily contains adjustments to adapt for changing
	kernel APIs over time.  Did a small labtest of kernel 3.18.6.

2011-12-02  Jesper Dangaard Brouer <hawk@comx.dk>

	* Version 0.9.3.

	This release is a minor update, with minor fixes.

	Some versions of Perl, gave a false positive warning:
	  "Useless use of private variable in void context"
	Which is now fixed.

	Fix typo in database/database-schema-latest.sql.

	Give fatal warning, if config file is missing.

2011-06-01  Jesper Dangaard Brouer <hawk@comx.dk>

	* Version 0.9.2.

	SNMP trap feature implemented.

	The collector sends SNMP "no_signal" traps, when the state
	transition from, signal to no-signal, and back from no-signal to
	signal.

	There is a SNMP MIB, describing the SNMP traps, located in
	"snmp/mibs/" named "IPTV-ANALYZER-MIB.txt".  The traps are placed
	under Enterprise OID 26124, which belongs to ComX Networks A/S.
	The CXNET-CORE-MIB.txt file describe this Enterprise OID.

	The iptv-collector now depends on the CPAN module NET::SNMP.

2011-05-24  Jesper Dangaard Brouer <hawk@comx.dk>

	* Version 0.9.1.

	New features include bytes and packet counters, no-signal detection,
	heartbeat system per stream, and new event types.

	Implemented packet and byte counters in the xt_mpeg2ts kernel
	module.  The iptv-collector, collects these counters and record
	delta values and timestamps to the database.

	NOTICE: Database changes. Updated database layout to support
	counters and delta update timestamps. Its possible to upgrade
	the database schema without loosing your current data.

	The collector handels detection of state transitions from, signal
	to no-signal, and back from no-signal to signal.  This is useful
	for (future) snmptrap facilities.

	Support periodic updating streams each heartbeat ticks.

2011-05-09  Jesper Dangaard Brouer <hawk@comx.dk>

	* Version 0.9.0.

	Change default iptables match criteria, to match all mpeg2ts
	packets.

	To make the module more generic, change the default match criteria
	to match on all correct mpeg2 TS packets (test for the sync 0x47
	byte in all TS frames).

	Drop detection is still active, and stats on packet drops are
	available via the proc filesystem.  These drop detection stats can
	be disabled via inverting the parameter --drop-detect,
	 eg. "!	--drop-detect".

	Its still possible to match on drop detection, via the parameter
	 "--match-drop" (which is default off).

2011-05-06  Jesper Dangaard Brouer <hawk@comx.dk>

	* Version 0.8.0.

	Major rewrite of the makefile system.

	Converted to project to use the well-known configure/autotools
	infrastructure, still in combination with the kernels Kbuild
	system.

	Also integrated configure with iptv-collector's Perl MakeMaker
	system.

2011-05-04  Jesper Dangaard Brouer <hawk@comx.dk>

	* Version 0.7.1.

	Minor fixes to the Makefiles and docs.

	 Want a release before starting on converting the project to use
	 autotools/automake/configure.

2011-04-20  Jesper Dangaard Brouer <hawk@comx.dk>

	* Version 0.7.0.

	Restructured the collector code.

	Notice: Collector config file renamed and changed location to:

	  /etc/iptv-analyzer/collector.conf

	(previously /etc/tvprobe.conf).

	The collector, also changed the Perl module layout to
	IPTV::Analyzer (used to be called tvprobe).

2011-04-18  Jesper Dangaard Brouer <hawk@comx.dk>

	* Version 0.6.0.

	Internal renaming from "mp2t" to "mpeg2ts"

	 The new name "mpeg2ts" much better acronym/shortname for MPEG2
	 Transport Stream.  The old name "mp2t" came from the Wireshark
	 acronym for this protocol.

	Renamed the iptables kernel module, from "mp2t" to "mpeg2ts".

	Renamed the Perl collector module, from "mp2t.pm" to "mpeg2ts.pm".

2011-04-14  Jesper Dangaard Brouer <hawk@comx.dk>

	* Version 0.3.2.

	Finally integrated Jan Engelhardts patches to the iptables module,
	back from the Netfilter Workshop, Oct. 2010.  These patches lived
	in the Xtables-addon branch named "mp2t".

	Making a release before:
	 Renaming the kernel module, from "mp2t" to "mpeg2ts".

2010-11-17  Jesper Dangaard Brouer <hawk@comx.dk>

	* Version 0.3.1.

	This version uses/integrates the compat_xtables kernel module from
	the Xtables-addons project.  This should (hopefully) make the
	iptables module compatible with more kernel versions.  In theory
	the kernel module should be compatible with kernel versions from
	2.6.27 to 2.6.36 (although this is untested).


2010-11-02  Jesper Dangaard Brouer <hawk@comx.dk>

	* Version 0.3.0-devel.

	This version change is only a developers release.  I just want to
	make sure that the SVN and GIT version uses a different version,
	to avoid confusion.

2010-10-29  Jesper Dangaard Brouer <hawk@comx.dk>

	* Converting from SVN to GIT

	The project is being prepared for going public.  The internal SVN
	code is converted to a GIT repository, for making it easier to
	cooperate with external developers.

	An SVN tag has been created at revision 2303, to mark the point
	where no further changes should go into SVN.

2010-10-15  Jesper Dangaard Brouer <hawk@comx.dk>

	* Version 0.2.1-devel.

	  Update the iptables module to be compatible with kernel 2.6.35.
	  Send the iptables code for review during Netfilter Workshop 2010.

2009-10-15  Jesper Dangaard Brouer <hawk@comx.dk>

	* Version 0.2.0-devel.

	  Significant changes to the proc file output.  Now everything in
	  the proc file consists of "key:value" pairs separated with
	  spaces.

2009-10-15  Jesper Dangaard Brouer <hawk@comx.dk>

	* SVN:[1555] Version 0.1.6.

	  This version correspond to the version currently (14/10-2009)
	  running in production on tvprobe002a and tvprobe003a.cxnet.dk.
	  This version needs some bug fixes, but I want a checkpoint and
	  a tagged SVN release.

2009-06-29  Jesper Dangaard Brouer <hawk@comx.dk>

	* SVN:[1143] Version 0.1.5
